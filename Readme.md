## Simple Java Website with GitLab CI/CD

This project implements a simple Java website and leverages GitLab CI/CD for automated build, testing, and deployment.

**Pipeline Stages:**

The CI/CD pipeline is meticulously crafted to streamline the development lifecycle:

1. **Install Tools:** This stage meticulously installs essential tools like Java, Maven, Docker, Trivy (vulnerability scanner), and kubectl (Kubernetes CLI) to prepare the environment for subsequent stages.
2. **Test:** This stage rigorously executes unit tests using Maven to ensure the application's functionality and identify potential issues early in the development process.
3. **Security Scan:** This stage meticulously performs security scans using Trivy to detect vulnerabilities in the codebase, safeguarding your application from potential security threats. Additionally, SonarQube is employed for comprehensive code quality analysis, enhancing maintainability and reliability.
4. **Package:** This stage meticulously packages the application using Maven, creating a deployable artifact ready for containerization.
5. **Build:** This stage meticulously builds a Docker image, encapsulating the application and its dependencies in a portable and self-contained unit, facilitating deployment across various environments.
6. **Deploy:** This stage meticulously deploys the Docker image to a self-hosted Kubernetes cluster (master-slave architecture), enabling horizontal scaling to accommodate increased traffic demands.

**Requirements:**

* **GitLab Runner:** A GitLab runner is essential for executing the pipeline stages on a designated machine.
* **GitLab CI/CD Variables:** Define essential variables within GitLab to securely store sensitive information like Docker registry credentials and the kubeconfig for Kubernetes deployment.

**Benefits:**

* **Automation:** The meticulously crafted CI/CD pipeline automates the entire build, test, and deployment process, minimizing manual intervention and reducing the risk of human error.
* **Enhanced Quality:** Rigorous unit tests and security scans using Trivy and SonarQube contribute to a more robust and secure application by identifying potential issues early in the development lifecycle.
* **Faster Deployments:** Automation streamlines the deployment process, enabling faster releases and improved development velocity.
* **Scalability:** The self-hosted Kubernetes cluster facilitates horizontal scaling to handle increased traffic demands, ensuring your application can accommodate growth.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Configure GitLab:**
   - Set up a GitLab repository for your project.
   - Ensure a GitLab runner is configured to execute the pipeline stages.
   - If integrating with SonarQube, activate a GitLab Ultimate license to create access tokens within GitLab.
2. **Define CI/CD Pipeline:**
   - Create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file within your project repository to define the CI/CD pipeline stages and their corresponding scripts.
3. **Set Up Kubernetes Cluster:**
   - Establish a self-hosted Kubernetes cluster (master-slave architecture) to serve as the deployment environment.
4. **Configure CI/CD Variables:**
   - Define essential variables within GitLab to securely store sensitive information like Docker registry credentials and the kubeconfig for Kubernetes deployment.

**Note:**

While GitLab CI/CD is a powerful tool for this project, keep in mind that GitHub Actions is the native CI/CD solution for GitHub repositories. If you intend to migrate this project to GitHub, you'll need to adapt the CI/CD pipeline definition using GitHub Actions syntax.

This README.md file provides a comprehensive overview of the project's CI/CD pipeline using GitLab. Refer to GitLab's documentation for detailed instructions on setting up CI/CD pipelines and integrating with specific tools like Trivy, SonarQube, and Kubernetes.
